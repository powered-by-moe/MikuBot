###Question 15:I'm building NadekoBot from source, but I get hundreds of (namespace) errors without changing anything!?
-----
**Answer:** Using Visual Studio, you can solve these errors by going to `Tools` -> `NuGet Package Manager` -> `Manage NuGet Packages for Solution`. Go to the Installed tab, select the Packages that were missing (usually `Newtonsoft.json` and `RestSharp`) and install them for all projects
###Question 16:  My bot has all permissions but it's still saying, "Failed to add roles. Bot has insufficient permissions.". How do I fix this?
----------
**Answer:** Discord has added a few new features and roles now follow hierarchy. This means you need to place your bot's role above every-other role your server has. 

**Please Note:** *The bot can only set/add all roles below its own highest role. It can not assign it's "highest role" to anyone else.*
