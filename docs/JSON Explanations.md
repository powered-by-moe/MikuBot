###Setting up your Credentials
If you do not see `credentials.json` you will need to rename `credentials_example.json` to `credentials.json`.

**This is how the unedited credentials look:**
```json
{
  "Token": "",
  "ClientId": "116275390695079945",
  "BotId": 1231231231231,
  "OwnerIds": [
  123123123123,
  5675675679845
  ],
  "GoogleAPIKey": "",
  "SoundCloudClientID": "",
  "MashapeKey": "",
  "LOLAPIKEY": "",
  "TrelloAPPKey": "",
  "OsuAPIKey": "",
  "CarbonKey": "",
}
```
####Required Parts
+ **Token** - Required to log in. Refer to this [guide](http://discord.kongslien.net/guide.html)
+ **OwnerIds** - Required for the **Owner-Only** commands. Seperate multiple Id's with a comma.
+ **BotId** - Required for custom reactions and conversation commands to work.  
  + **Important : Bot ID and Client ID are the same in newer bot accounts due to recent Discord API changes.** 

_BotId and the OwnerIds are **NOT** the names of the owner and the bot. If you do not know the id of your bot, keep the two random numbers in those fields and 
run the bot then do  `.uid @MyBotName` - this will give you your bot_id.
Do the same for yourself with `.uid @MyName` Put these numbers in their respective field of the credentials._

Config.json
===========
In the folder where `NadekoBot.exe` is located you should also see a `Data` folder. In this folder you will find `config.json` among other files.
`config.json` contains user specific commands, such as: if DM's sent to the bot are forwarded to you, Blacklisted Ids, Servers, and channels...etc.

**If you do not see** `config.json` **you need to rename** `config_example.json` **to** `config.json`
